# S.O.L.I.D Principles

Violating DRY in code  ??

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (51).png>)



**S.O.L.I.D** is an acronym for the **first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles** .These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

1. _**S**_RP The Single Responsibility Principle: — a class should have one, and only one, reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
2. _**O**_CP The Open Closed Principle: — you should be able to extend a class’s behavior, without modifying it.
3. _**L**_SP The Liskov Substitution Principle: — If any module is using a Base class then the reference to that Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the module.
4. _**I**_SP The Interface Segregation Principle: — make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
5. _**D**_IP The Dependency Inversion Principle — depend on abstractions not on concrete implementations.
